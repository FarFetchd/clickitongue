## Clickitongue

Clickitongue is a tool that removes the need to physically click mouse buttons, to help people with severe pain from repetitive-strain-injured wrists. **Its goal is for an experienced mouse user to feel no more encumbered than they would clicking normally with their fingers.** Clickitongue learns to recognize specific sounds, and issues clicks (left and right) in response. It can tolerate noisy environments - people talking, air conditioners running nearby - without issuing spurious clicks.

Clickitongue is available to everyone free of charge under the GPLv3. It runs on Linux (both X and Wayland), Windows, and OSX.

## Goals and Motivation

Clickitongue is unlike other assistive technologies, in that it specifically targets repetitive strain injury rather than full disability. Assistive technologies for people without any use of their fingers need to cover the entirety of what is normally done with mouse+keyboard. It is inevitable that they will be slower and/or more annoying than mouse+keyboard, since nothing compares to the dexterity of fingers. This degraded experience makes them all but unusable for all but the worst RSI: if you are an expert mouse+keyboard user using a tool that gives you half your full capacity, and that full capacity (plus some pain) is constantly at your fingertips, sooner or later you'll give in.

Clickitongue focuses solely on the worst RSI culprit - mouse clicks - allowing users to escape that trap. Clickitongue will not slow you down and will not annoy you. You are simply issuing mouse clicks, and using whisper-quiet puffs of air to do so. Furthermore, you are not investing in learning an entire new ecosystem of input methods: Clickitongue's setup, training, and usage are all extremely simple. Clickitongue prioritizes a smooth experience over all else, in all ways.

## Usage

On the first run, Clickitongue will have you select your audio input device, and then guide you through its training process. The training is quick; it should take about two to five minutes total. 

Just about any microphone, including webcam or built-in laptop mics, should get you basic functionality. However, for really smooth operation the mic needs to be positioned near your mouth. [More details here.](https://github.com/FarFetchd/clickitongue#mic-advice)
