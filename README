good params: 35 0.15 0.43 0.31

Must have the portaudio shared lib installed, so that -lportaudio will work. To
install, get the portaudio source, and then in there:

$ ./configure --disable-static
$ make
$ make install




-lxdo needs, i think, apt install libxdo-dev

-lfftw3 needs
sudo apt install libfftw3-dev
