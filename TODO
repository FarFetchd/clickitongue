* the default config file location is currently linux specific... hmm maybe in windows they can just live in the .exe dir.
* if we want tongue clicks to be right click alongside a puff/blow left click, then we'll need to add logic to tongue click
to expect a LACK of energy outside the expected range.
*** and/or: record the tongue+blow examples outside of the training, and then feed both to both, with the other's as examples where there should be 0 events.
* make windows exe+dll+data release package (and keep updated)

wishlist
* support osx   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369806/simulating-mouse-clicks-on-mac-os-x-does-not-work-for-some-applications
* easy selection among multiple profiles: it seems different rooms can have different enough acoustics to cause problems.
* fun idea: ascending and descending whistles to control scroll wheel. need to track frequencies at a finer resolution; try
  "zoom FFT" (https://2015fallhw.github.io/arcidau/ZoomFFT.html)
* FFTW wisdom
* translate into all languages we can get translators for
* debian package
