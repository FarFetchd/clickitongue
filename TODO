NEW IDEAS:

NICE!!!! hum works! blow should inhibit hum, both during, and also set hum's refrac when ending.


* "tuning": after training, push a param in the desirable way with binary search, finding how far you can push before the score gets worse. then, set the param to (say) halfway between orig and the breaking point.
    * definitely good for making the EWMA alpha as responsive as possible.
    * probably also good for on/off thresholds? on being pushed lower, off being pushed higher.



* whistle (breathing in): single massive peak, low freqs should have little energy
interesting: when the mic is close enough to your mouth, the odd overtones show up. also a bit of the evens, but not nearly as much.
is this just me/my mic/my environment, or more universal? sounds universal, that's cool!

* make windows exe+dll+data release package (and keep updated)
* handle the double keypress in training
* polished, easy to follow training instructions

wishlist
* tell them if training failed because they were too soft, or there was too much noise. (based on whether negative or positive examples were failing).
* for left clicks: make a short period after the refractory period has passed more sensitive, to make double-click easier
* support osx   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369806/simulating-mouse-clicks-on-mac-os-x-does-not-work-for-some-applications
* easy selection among multiple profiles: it seems different rooms can have different enough acoustics to cause problems.
* fun idea: ascending and descending whistles to control scroll wheel. need to track frequencies at a finer resolution; try
  "zoom FFT" (https://2015fallhw.github.io/arcidau/ZoomFFT.html)
* translate into all languages we can get translators for
* debian package






# CONFIG NOTES

audio profile should be "Analog Stereo Duplex"







# USABILITY NOTES

We have 3 good candidates: whistling, humming, up-close blowing. Not everybody can whistle. Humming may be hard to distinguish from talking. Not everybody can have a mic close enough for blowing.

Ideal (if want to be robust to talking): up-close blowing for left click, whistle for right
Ideal (if don't need to be talking, since humming is easier): blow left, hum right
***if only talking sometimes: whistle to pause/unpause


looks like humming will be the least common denom here. (is fem humming much different?)
