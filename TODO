i wonder if my difficulties on the desktop are due to scaling. if the blowing is
just off the charts huge no matter what, and takes precedence in determining scaling,
maybe humming wants a larger scale (out of bounds of the allowed param range).

* "tuning": after training, push a param in the desirable way with binary search, finding how far you can push before the score gets worse. then, set the param to (say) halfway between orig and the breaking point.
    * DEFINITELY want: make it quite hard indeed to go from on to off.


* whistle (breathing in): single massive peak, low freqs should have little energy
interesting: when the mic is close enough to your mouth, the odd overtones show up. also a bit of the evens, but not nearly as much.
is this just me/my mic/my environment, or more universal? sounds universal, that's cool!

* make windows exe+dll+data release package (and keep updated)

wishlist
* for left clicks: make a short period after the refractory period has passed more sensitive, to make double-click easier
* support osx   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369806/simulating-mouse-clicks-on-mac-os-x-does-not-work-for-some-applications
* easy selection among multiple profiles: it seems different rooms can have different enough acoustics to cause problems.
* fun idea: ascending and descending whistles to control scroll wheel. need to track frequencies at a finer resolution; try
  "zoom FFT" (https://2015fallhw.github.io/arcidau/ZoomFFT.html)
* translate into all languages we can get translators for
* debian package






# CONFIG NOTES

audio profile should be "Analog Stereo Duplex"







# USABILITY NOTES

We have 3 good candidates: whistling, humming, up-close blowing. Not everybody can whistle. Humming may be hard to distinguish from talking. Not everybody can have a mic close enough for blowing.

Ideal (if want to be robust to talking): up-close blowing for left click, whistle for right
Ideal (if don't need to be talking, since humming is easier): blow left, hum right
***if only talking sometimes: whistle to pause/unpause


looks like humming will be the least common denom here. (is fem humming much different?)
