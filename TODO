hmm... i have a feeling we should be dynamically choosing 1 vs 2 channels...

dont make them redo both if only one training bad... implemented but not tested.
test both good the first time, one good and retry, one good and give up.

wishlist
* easy selection among multiple profiles: it seems different rooms can have different enough acoustics to cause problems.
* fun idea: ascending and descending whistles to control scroll wheel. need to track frequencies at a finer resolution; try
  "zoom FFT" (https://2015fallhw.github.io/arcidau/ZoomFFT.html)
* translate into all languages we can get translators for
* debian package



* whistle (breathing in): single massive peak, low freqs should have little energy
interesting: when the mic is close enough to your mouth, the odd overtones show up. also a bit of the evens, but not nearly as much.
is this just me/my mic/my environment, or more universal? sounds universal, that's cool!

# CONFIG NOTES

audio profile should be "Analog Stereo Duplex"







# USABILITY NOTES

We have 3 good candidates: whistling, humming, up-close blowing. Not everybody can whistle. Humming may be hard to distinguish from talking. Not everybody can have a mic close enough for blowing.

Ideal (if want to be robust to talking): up-close blowing for left click, whistle for right
Ideal (if don't need to be talking, since humming is easier): blow left, hum right
***if only talking sometimes: whistle to pause/unpause


looks like humming will be the least common denom here. (is fem humming much different?)
