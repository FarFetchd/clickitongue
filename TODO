* cumulative training examples, across multiple sessions
* idea for easy manual tuning: the tuning algorithm in there now might be good for
  "user clicked a button saying make it more/less sensitive". maybe have a standard
  pullback of like 0.8 so they can do it once for a little, or repeatedly for more.
* have some buttons/input during running that allows users to easily apply what's described in the "Manual Tuning" section of the readme.
  the idea is it would look like "make left clicking easier" "make left clicking harder" etc.
* fun idea: ascending and descending whistles or humming to control scroll wheel.
  need to track frequencies at a finer resolution; try
  "zoom FFT" (https://2015fallhw.github.io/arcidau/ZoomFFT.html)
* debian package
* brew install
