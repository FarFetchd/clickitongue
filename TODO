* get the blows and clicks to play together nicely
* make windows exe+dll+data release package (and keep updated)
* handle the double keypress in training
* polished, easy to follow training instructions

wishlist
* for left clicks: make a short period after the refractory period has passed more sensitive, to make double-click easier
* support osx   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369806/simulating-mouse-clicks-on-mac-os-x-does-not-work-for-some-applications
* easy selection among multiple profiles: it seems different rooms can have different enough acoustics to cause problems.
* fun idea: ascending and descending whistles to control scroll wheel. need to track frequencies at a finer resolution; try
  "zoom FFT" (https://2015fallhw.github.io/arcidau/ZoomFFT.html)
* translate into all languages we can get translators for
* debian package
