* get the blows and clicks to play together nicely
****idea: keep feeding tongue examples to blow as negatives, but no longer do the reverse. instead, add logic that suppresses tongue activations when blow has recently been activated. (give tongue a few block activation delay to accommodate). eh..... tried it, seems like it's hard to get the blow detector to not trigger on tongue clicks.

NEW IDEAS:
* nose hum (works with headset, bet it wouldn't work with earbuds and especially not standalone mike) (and i THINK it's possible to filter out talking: talking will have high freq noise spikes, nose hum won't.)
* whistle: single massive peak, low freqs should have little energy
* blow as pink noise: every octave should have ~equal energy.




back-to-basics note on FFT/DFT: ok, so the FFT outputs are spooky complex numbers. i knew that. apparently what you're ACTUALLY supposed to do with them, to get the power present in each freq bin, is to square the magnitude of each, i.e. real_part^2 + imag_part_coeff^2.
*****the distributor should do this.
*****search for all fabs().



* make windows exe+dll+data release package (and keep updated)
* handle the double keypress in training
* polished, easy to follow training instructions

wishlist
* tell them if training failed because they were too soft, or there was too much noise. (based on whether negative or positive examples were failing).
* for left clicks: make a short period after the refractory period has passed more sensitive, to make double-click easier
* support osx   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369806/simulating-mouse-clicks-on-mac-os-x-does-not-work-for-some-applications
* easy selection among multiple profiles: it seems different rooms can have different enough acoustics to cause problems.
* fun idea: ascending and descending whistles to control scroll wheel. need to track frequencies at a finer resolution; try
  "zoom FFT" (https://2015fallhw.github.io/arcidau/ZoomFFT.html)
* translate into all languages we can get translators for
* debian package
